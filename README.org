#+TITLE: MikTex Portable
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
* Introduction
This is MikTeX portable.  While there is already a portable version of
MiKTeX available, this is defferent from the standard in the following
ways:

1. NSIS launchers
   1. MikTexOptions
   2. MikTexPortable
   3. TexWorksPortable
   4. YapPortable
2. NSIS installer

Everything else works the same.
